# Appbuilder9000

The purpose of this repository is for presentation of the first of two live projects of a two-week duration completed during the duration of my time whilst attending [The Tech 
Academy Software Developer Bootcamp](https://www.learncodinganywhere.com/codingbootcamps), based in Portland, Oregon and is a subsidiary of Â© Prosper Consulting Inc.

## Overview

The Tech Academy created a Django-based based multi-application simulation website that would essentially serve as a landing page to which a user could navigate to multiple sites each of which would be built around a specific topic of each team member's choosing.  My application for this project was based on the topic of inline speed skating, a hobby with which I have participated since my youth.  The end product for the application would be a Django Rest Framework in Python. 

Requirements for this assignment included development of the site made up of the following: 

* Database collection manager
* Restful API inteface
* Data Scraping with Beautiful Soup

Working on multi-application project was a tremendous learning experience on many levels.


Stepping into a project that was already underway was (in my view) about as "real-world" of an experience as I can imagine to prepare me for my future roles in software developement.

Below are descriptions of the stories I worked on, along with code snippets and navigation links. I also have some full code files in this repo for the larger functionalities I implemented.  Please note, during the time that this project was ongoing, I experienced some personal challenges that impacted my ability to complete as many project stories as I had intended upon inception of the project.  However, I have attempted to provide perspective as it concerns the manner in which I approach and execute relative to the work that I produce. 




Finally, utilizing a DevOps project management methodologies, incorporating Scrum task tracking, and Agile Boards was such a different experience from other projects I have participated that were not of a software development nature as it concerns.  I am astounded at the the effectiveness of these methods as it concerns efficiency, task management, accuracy and so on.  They are extremely powerful and I am very excited to venture into an industry that takes such a methodical and contrived approach to the work that I will do in the coming years.
